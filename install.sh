#do a system report of the system-if can not because need a program then install something that can do so.... -checking system specs-line 5-
#nano /etc/init.d/ondemand change the governer to high/max for the installation-maybe change it back after the install.
#/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_available_governors
#additional drivers command to search and install at the very begining of the script search for the title of "#02 - Installing additional drivers"-if restart maybe needed to complete the install-Then either write code to stop the script make the rest of the script as a job/cronjob on the next reboot-or if it is safe to continue on then reboot after the "spinup" is completed all tasks[even the kernal and grub stuff,tricky stuff] Remeber to place a job in either code config to do a system update and ask if the enduser wants to update as the first task on start up after the desktop fully loads and the internet connect is available.
